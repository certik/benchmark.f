# Simple Example {#example_poisson}

This example was directly taken from [fortran-lang](https://github.com/fortran-lang/benchmarks/tree/main/poisson2d).
It proposes to benchmark different implementations of a solver for the 2D Poisson equation.
The solver uses a simple Jacobi iteration methods. For details, see, "Computational Physics" by Mark Newman, Chap 9.
